      <google-codelab-step label="Overview">
        <p>In this codelab, you&#39;ll make a maze game.</p>

        <ul class="checklist">
          <li>Quick review of Scratch.</li>
            <li>How to incorporate micro:bits into a Scratch game!</li>
        </ul>

      </google-codelab-step>

      <google-codelab-step label="Remix the starter project">
        <p>Open the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/490517530/editor/" target="_blank">starter project</a> and click <b>Remix</b>.</p>
        <img src="img/click_remix.png">

      </google-codelab-step>

      <google-codelab-step label="Add the micro:bit Extension">
        <p>Before we begin, we must add the <b>micro:bit extension</b> so that we can incorporate the microcontroller into our project. To do this, click on the <b>extensions</b> block in the bottom right corner.</p>
        <img style="max-width: 200px" src="img/extension.png">
        <p>Once you navigate to the extension page, choose the micro:bit extension: </p>
        <img style="max-width: 600px" src="img/microbit_extension.png">
        <p>When trying to add this, you'll get a box that is searching for your micro:bit.</p>
        <img style="max-width: 600px" src="img/microbit_connecting.png">
        <p>A successful search should look as shown below.</p>
        <img style="max-width: 600px" src="img/successful_microbit_search.png">
        <p>If your screen doesn't look like this/your micro:bit doesn't show up on the screen, check the following things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Is your micro:bit on? Check that it is either connected to your computer <b>and/or</b> to the battery pack.</li>
          <li>Is your ScratchLink activated? Scratch cannot connect if ScratchLink is not on and running.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you see your micro:bit on the screen, click the blue <b>Connect</b> button followed by the blue<b>Go to editor</b> button to keep working on your project. Both of them are in the lower right-hand corner of this pop-up box. This is how your screen should look before you click the "Go to editor" button.</p>
        <img style="max-width: 600px" src="img/connected.png">
      </google-codelab-step>

      <google-codelab-step label="The micro:bit Blocks">
        <p>After you add the micro:bit extension, you should see a micro:bit section in your Code list. This will show these blocks:</p>
        <img style="max-width: 300px" src="img/microbit_blocks.png">
        <p>All of these block <i>shapes</i> should look familiar because they're all similar to blocks that we've worked with in the past. We can see <i>hat blocks</i> that trigger events, namely starting sections of code. We also see <i>hexagonal</i> blocks, which are used for sensing and conditional statements. Finally we see <i>rounded</i> blocks which can be used as variables and our typical action blocks that can be used for actions, motions, looks, and more!</p>
      </google-codelab-step>

      <google-codelab-step label="Move with the micro:bit">
        <p>Now, we are going to program the Coder sprite to move according to how the micro:bit moves.</p>
        <aside class="callout">
          <h2>Reminder</h2>
          <p><b>Recall</b> that to start a program, we need a <b>hat block</b>. These can be found both in the "Events" or "micro:bit" sections in the Code list. In this program, let's opt for the program to start when the green flag is clicked.</p>
          <img src="img/hat_flag.png">
        </aside>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>When the micro:bit is tilted right and left, make the Coder girl move inn that direction along the x (the x-axis corresponds to "right" and "left"). We recommend using some of these blocks, combined with other blocks that you've already used in the past.<br>
            <img style="max-width: 200px" src="img/tilt_blocks.png.png"></li>
          <li>Repeat this for the vertical direction (change y). It might take some experimenting with what Scratch considers "front" and "back" tilt to be.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Check yourself:</b> If you run the program with the green flag, does your Coder girl move how you want her to?</p>
      </google-codelab-step>


      <google-codelab-step label="Check if She's Touching the Wall">
        <p>Now we will check if the superhero is touching the wall and lose the game if she is</p>
        <img style="max-width: 400px" src="img/wall_sensor_explain.png">
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Have the superhero check if she's touching the black wall, and say "game over" if she is <br>
          <li>If the game ends, the superhero should also return to the starting position (-190, -115) so the game can restart.<br>
             <img style="max-width: 200px" src="img/go_to_house.png"><br>
          <li>This check should happen over and over while you're playing the game (remember the forever loop!) <br>
            <img style="max-width: 200px" src="img/forever.png"><br>
          <li>She should start checking if she's touching the wall when the game begins (remember Hat blocks!) </li>
            <img style="max-width: 200px" src="img/hat_flag.png"><br>
        </ol>
        <p>Scratch is very sensitive to the micro:bit tilts, so it might be <i>very</i> difficult to make this sprite go through the maze without touching the walls. Try to think of creative solutions to make the game more do-able! It can be anything you want (even if it means replacing the step you just did with something else).</p>
      </google-codelab-step>


      <google-codelab-step label="Check if She Reached the Laptop">
        <p>Now we will check if the Coder girl is touching the laptop and win the game if she is</p>
        <img style="max-width: 400px" src="img/win_explain.png">
        <p> She can check if she's touching the Laptop in a similar way to how she checked if she was touching a black wall. </p>
        <p> The Laptop is a sprite, not a color, so be sure to use the right block! </p>
      </google-codelab-step>


      <google-codelab-step label="Bonus Features">
        Once you have a working maze game, choose one or more additional features to add!
        <ol>
          <li> Draw your own maze background! You can do this by changing the backdrop. If you want to make the superhero smaller, you can do that with a block in the Looks category
          <li> Change the sprites for the player, home and goal of the maze
          <li> Make something exciting happen when the game is lost or won
          <li> Look at other scratch users' mazes <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/138299/"> here </a> for more inspiration, or think of your own additons!

        </ol>

      <google-codelab-step label="Finishing Up">
        When you're finished, be sure to save and share your project, and then add it to the studio:
        <ol>
          <li> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/25249649/"> Giga studio </a>.
          <li> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/25247924/"> Nano studio </a>.
        </ol>
