          In this codelab, you'll make your own machine learning model and
          integrate it into your own Scratch project!

            Use <b>conditional (if) </b> blocks to check for class

      <google-codelab-step label="Note about Project Format">
        <p>
          There will be no remixable Scratch workspace for this project because
          it involves technology that is not yet compatible with Scratch. You
          currently are unable to immediately save to your workspace.
        </p>
        <p>
          That being said, there is a way to still save your project, which will
          be explained later on.
        </p>
      </google-codelab-step>

      <google-codelab-step label="Create your Learning Model">
        <p>
          First, we are going to make our own machine learning model using
          Teachable Machines.
        </p>

        <aside class="callout">
          <h2>Supervised Learning</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Supervised learning</b> is a type of machine learning that
            "learns" an algorithm for predicting output based on input.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason it is <b>supervised</b> is because it uses a labeled
            dataset. An example of a labeled dataset is a collection of images
            of dogs that have specifically been labeled as "dog". Another
            example is a collection of text files that have all been labeled as
            "knock knock jokes".
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, we will not be able to go in-depth into machine
            learning, but we hope that Teachable Machines helps you better see
            what it is.
          </p>
        </aside>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Navigate to
            <a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank"
              >this link</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            Go the menu bar in the top left corner of your screen, and click on
            "New Project".
          </li>
          <li>Click on "Image Project".</li>
          <li>
            There are two types of image inputs you can use for this project:
            <ul>
              <li>Images from your webcam</li>
              <li>Images that are files on your computer</li>
            </ul>
            Feel free to choose the image input type that appeals more to you.
            If you run into any issues with your webcam, we recommend you use
            image files rather than your webcam.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </google-codelab-step>

      <google-codelab-step label="Webcam Data Collection">
        <p>
          In this section, you're going to import data from your webcam to train
          your very own learning model with!
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >If your webcam is not working, please move to the next page to
            learn about how to import image files as your data.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          In the following steps, we'll be explaining how to train your model to
          detect when you have your hand raised and when you do not. This is
          just an example of two classes you could make. Feel free to make your
          own classes and as many classes as you want! (Note: Having many
          classes might confuse your model, so do be wary of this.)
        </p>
        <aside class="callout">
          Hi emily and shelly -- would a callout about what data is be too much
          extra content? idk if this will be too much and stray from the mission
          of codeit
        </aside>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            You should be at a page that looks like this:<br />
            <img src="img/start_page.png" style="max-width: 500px;" />
          </li>
          <li>
            We'll start with you <b>not</b> raising your hand. Under Class 1,
            click "Webcam" and hold down on "Hold to Record" to take images.<br />
            <img src="img/webcam.png" style="max-width: 60px;" /><br />
            <img src="img/hold_to_record.png" style="max-width: 170px;" /><br />
            <img src="img/hand-down-class.png" style="max-width: 230px;" />
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat the previous step, but this time with your hand raised and
            under Class 2. It should look something like this: <br />
            <img src="img/hand-up-class.png" style="max-width: 230px;" />
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, label your two classes to be appropriately descriptive
            (i.e. "Normal" and "Hand Raised") by clicking on the pencil icon by
            the class name. <br />
            <img src="img/pencil-icon.png" style="max-width: 100px;" />
          </li>
        </ol>

        <aside class="callout">
          <h2>Is your data fair and representative?</h2>
          <p>
            In order for your learning model to be as accurate as possible, you
            should make sure that your data fits the following qualifications:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Take images from <b>all angles</b> (like rotating your head and/or
              body)
            </li>
            <li>Collect at least <b>100 images</b> for each class</li>
            <li>
              Take similar numbers of images for each class
            </li>
          </ul>
          Why do you think we need representative and diverse data? If you have
          the time, try training a model with very flawed and unbalanced data
          (i.e. 100 images for one class and 300 images for the other). What do
          you think will happen, and what did you observe happening?
        </aside>

      <google-codelab-step label="Image File Data Collegction">
        <p>
          In this section, we're going to go over how to use image files as your
          data to train your model.

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Before you start the data collection, you're going to need to move
            the image files to your Google Drive. Go to this
            <a
              href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uCNnUd0xm6Hv9h_90iw79P95vH6MNIS3?usp=sharing"

            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Right click on "CodeIt Teachable Machines Image Files".<br />
            <img src="img/img-folder.png" style="max-width: 500px;" />
          </li>
          <li>
            Click on "Add shortcut to Drive" in the popup menu.<br />
            <img src="img/add-shortcut.png" style="max-width: 200px;" />
          </li>
          <li>
            Go back to the Teachable Machines tab. You should be at a page that
            looks like this:<br />
            <img src="img/start_page.png" style="max-width: 500px;" />
          </li>
          <li>
            For Class 1, click on the "Upload" button. <br />
            <img src="img/upload-btn.png" style="max-width: 90px;" />
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, click "Import images from Google Drive". <br />
            <img src="img/import-imgs-btn.png" style="max-width: 200px;" />
          </li>
          <li>
            Double click into "CodeIt Teachable Machines Image Files". If it
            doesn't appear at the top, search for it in the search bar.<br />
            <img src="img/google-drive-search.png" style="max-width: 400px;" />
          </li>
          <li>
            Select the "Class 1 Training Dataset" folder.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat the last four steps but for Class 2 and using the "Class 2
            Training Dataset" folder. By this point, your two classes should
            look something like this: <br />
            <img
              src="img/both-classes.png"
              style="max-width: 200px;"

            />
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, label your two classes to be appropriately descriptive
            (i.e. "Normal" and "Hand Raised") by clicking on the pencil icon by
            the class name. <br />
            <img src="img/pencil-icon.png" style="max-width: 100px;" />
          </li>
        </ol>

        <aside class="callout">
          <h2>Is your data fair and representative?</h2>
          What did you notice about the distribution of the image files? Were
          they equally represented? Did both classes have similar amounts of
          image files?
        </aside>
      </google-codelab-step>

      <google-codelab-step label="How to Train your Model">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Now that you've collected all your training data (whether that be
            through your webcam or with image files), click the "Train Model"
            button. Make sure to <b>not switch tabs</b> while you're doing
