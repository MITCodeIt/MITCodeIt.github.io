      <google-codelab-step label="Overview">
        <p>In this codelab, you&#39;ll make a cloning game.</p>
        <aside class="callout">
          <h2>How to play</h2>
          <p>The Player is the blue circle, the green circles are friendly, and the red circles are the enemies. Move the blue circle around with your mouse, collect the green circles and avoid the red ones. Touching a friend will win you a point and touching an enemy will take away 3 points. If you score more than 20 points, you win! But score less than -20 and you lose...</p>

        <h3 class="checklist">What you&#39;ll learn</h3>
        <ul class="checklist">
          <li><b>Clone</b> multiple sprites.</li>
          <li>Use <b>variables</b> to keep track of the score to know when a player wins or loses.</li>
          <li>Edit <b>costumes</b> to explore clone properties.</li>
        </ul>

      </google-codelab-step>

      <google-codelab-step label="Remix the starter project">
        <p>Open the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/413069975/editor/" target="_blank">starter project</a> and click <b>Remix</b>.</p>
      </google-codelab-step>

      <google-codelab-step label="Setting the Score">
        <p>First, we are going to create the score variable to keep track during the game.</p>
        <img style="max-width: 400px" src="img/make-score.png">
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a new variable and name it "Score."<br>
          <li>In the Player's code, make sure that the score <i>is set to zero</i> at the beginning of the game.<br>
          <li>Have the Player follow the mouse for the entire game.</li>
        </ol>

      </google-codelab-step>


      <google-codelab-step label="Creating an Army of Friends">
        <p>Before we can make more friends, we have to make our current one move.</p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>For the entire game, we want the <b>Friends</b> to move around the screen. Choose a <b>random direction</b> for the sprite to <b>point</b>; your bounds should be -180 and 180 (a full circle).</li>
          <li>For the entire game, change directions every 250 steps. But have the sprite only move 10 steps at a time. How many times do you need to <i>repeat</i> this until you get to 250?</li>
          <li>Continuously check to make sure that the sprite isn't on the edge of the screen... if it is, have it bounce.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now we will make sure that we have enough friends to help us win the game. Let&#39;s get to cloning!</p>
        <img style="max-width: 400px" src="img/green-clones.png">
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Every time after moving 250 steps, the green circle should <b>clone itself</b>.<br>
          <li>Currently, every time we make a clone, it'll look exactly the same as the original - let's change this. Begin editing code for when the <i>clone begins</i>. What type of block is this?<br>
             <img style="max-width: 200px" src="img/clone-hat-block.png"><br>
          <li>In order to make the clones look different, <i>set the ghost effect to 50</i> at the beginning of the clone's life.<br>
          <li>Have the clones slowly approach the Player. How do we get the clones to move towards the Player? How many steps should each clone move at once (think about whether moving 10 steps is slower or faster than moving 1 step)?</li>
          <li>Each clone should move only 300 steps before it <b>deletes itself</b>.</li>
        </ol>

      </google-codelab-step>


      <google-codelab-step label="Scoring Points">
        <p>How will the Player earn points? By reaching its friends.</p>
        <img style="max-width: 400px" src="img/increase-score.png">
        <p>Attempt this by yourself, here are some questions to consider:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How does the <i>clone</i> know if it's touching the Player?</li>
          <li>How can we show that the score changes when the Players earns a point?</li>
          <li>Should the clone still exist after the Player reaches it or should it delete?</li>
        </ul>
      </google-codelab-step>


      <google-codelab-step label="Enemies">
        <img style="max-width: 400px" src="img/enemy-clones.png">
        <p>Repeat the process of creating clones to the Enemy sprite.</p>
        <p>However, the enemies make the Player lose 3 points. Reflect this in the score variable.</p>
      </google-codelab-step>

      <google-codelab-step label="Win or Lose?">
        <p>We need to be able to stop the game when the Player either wins or loses.</p>
        <h2>Steps (in the same section of code already written for the Player sprite)</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Throughout the entire game, <i>forever</i>, check the value of the score. If the score is <b>greater</b> than 20, the Player should win. How can the Player tell the user that they won?</li>
          <li>Similarly to the step before, if the score is <b>less</b> than -20, the Player sprite should tell the user that they lost.</li>
          <li>In both cases 1 and 2, the <b>script should stop</b> to end the game.</li>
        </ol>
      </google-codelab-step>


      <google-codelab-step label="Bonus Features">
        Once you have a working maze game, choose one or more additional features to add!
        <ol>
          <li> Draw your own maze background! You can do this by changing the backdrop. If you want to make the superhero smaller, you can do that with a block in the Looks category
          <li> Change the sprites for the player, home and goal of the maze
          <li> Make something exciting happen when the game is lost or won
          <li> Look at other scratch users' mazes <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/138299/"> here </a> for more inspiration, or think of your own additons!

        </ol>

      </google-codelab-step>

      <google-codelab-step label="Finishing Up">
        When you're finished, be sure to save and share your project, and then add it to the studio:
        <ol>
          <li> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/25249649/"> Giga studio </a>.
          <li> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/25247924/"> Nano studio </a>.
        </ol>
